PS: Do not execute the sh's directly!!

To test:

make install		(installs AGL graphics)

make test			(compiles the tester)
./test				(executes the tester)

The sh files makes the assumption that the project folder is ~/aleva/agl/agl-text

Requirements:
- SDL development packages installed (base SDL, image, ttf, mixer)
- Base AGL installed (with headers for development)
- verify the commands in the ".sh" file and adapt to the operating system in use
